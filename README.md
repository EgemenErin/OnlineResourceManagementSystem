# Online Resource Management System

This project is part of an advanced object-oriented programming course, designed to manage online resources efficiently. It focuses on implementing a **database-connected version** of the system, fulfilling several essential features.

## Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage online resources with create, read, update, and delete functionalities.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless connection with a database for persistent data storage.
- **Concurrency Management**: Handle multiple operations simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Robust Testing**: Includes comprehensive **JUnit tests** for all functionalities to ensure reliability.
- **Scalability**: Built with a modular approach to allow future enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database Connectivity**: JDBC
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-resource-management-system.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a database in your preferred RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Update the database connection details in the `config.properties` file.

4. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Usage
- Interact with the system via the terminal or a GUI interface (depending on the implemented task).
- Manage online resources efficiently by performing CRUD operations.

## Project Roadmap
This project will evolve through the following stages:

1. **Task 1**: Terminal-based application implementation.
2. **Task 2**: Database integration (current version).
3. **Task 3**: Desktop application using JavaFX.
4. **Task 4**: Web application with REST API support using Spring.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for advanced search and filtering options.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Provide detailed analytics and reporting features.
